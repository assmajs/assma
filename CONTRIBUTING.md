# Contributing to Assma

We'd be delighted if you could contribute to Assma and help us make it even better than it is now!
Here are the guidelines we'd want you to follow as a contributor. 

## <a name="submit"></a> Submission Guidelines

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> Submitting an Issue

Please explore the issue tracker before submitting an issue; an issue for your problem may already exist, and the discussion may advise you of workarounds that are easily available.

We want to fix all of the issues as fast as possible, but we need to reproduce and validate each one first.
We will require you to submit a basic reproduction scenario using a repository or [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) in order to reproduce errors.
Having a live, reproducible scenario allows us to get a variety of useful information without having to contact you with extra questions.
